## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com) - Sassy Cascading Style Sheets

### What I learned

Actually, nothing special, the challenges that were in the project, I already had experience with them. What was probably less known to me was the input validation check in Javascript.

```js
const userInput = document.getElementById("user-input");
if(!userInput.checkValidity()) {}
```

### Continued development

First I want to finish the javascript course I'm taking on freecodecamp, I'm also going through the learning path on Frontendmentor, and after that I want to focus more on React, Next.js and Node.js.

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This is my favorite documentation platform I've been using since I started programming, it's the best explained resource.
- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) - I'm always looking for news and listening to other developers, sharing their experiences so that I can see many different solutions to a problem.
